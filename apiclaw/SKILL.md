# APIClaw — Commerce Data Infrastructure for AI Agents

200M+ Amazon products. 12 endpoints. One API key.

## Quick Start
1. Get key: [apiclaw.io/api-keys](https://apiclaw.io/en/api-keys) (1,000 free credits)
2. `export APICLAW_API_KEY='hms_live_xxx'`
3. Base URL: `https://api.apiclaw.io/openapi/v2` — all POST with JSON body
4. Auth: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
5. New keys need 3-5s to activate. If 403, wait and retry.

## ⚠️ Critical API Pitfalls (ALL skills must follow)
1. **Keyword search is broad** → MUST lock `categoryPath` first via `categories` endpoint
2. **Brand/price-band queries MUST include --category** to avoid cross-category contamination
3. **Revenue** = `sampleAvgMonthlyRevenue` directly. **NEVER** calculate avgPrice × totalSales (overestimates 30-70%)
4. **Sales** = `monthlySalesFloor` (lower bound). Fallback: 300,000 / BSR^0.65, tag as 🔍
5. **Use API fields directly**: `sampleOpportunityIndex`, `sampleTop10BrandSalesRate` — never reinvent
6. **reviews/analysis** needs 50+ reviews. Fallback chain when sample is insufficient:
   1. Lightweight: `realtime/product` → `ratingBreakdown` (star distribution only, no themes)
   2. Full 11-dim insights: `realtime/reviews` (raw text, up to 100) + local Map/Reduce via the
      Local Review Toolkit below — see "Local Review Toolkit" section
7. **Aggregation endpoints** (price-band, brand) without categoryPath produce severely distorted data
8. **Price-band and brand endpoints only accept `keyword`** (not categoryPath) — cross-validate returned products

## On 401 Invalid Key

When `apiclaw.py` returns `{"code": 401, "message": "API Key invalid or expired"}`:

1. **STOP further endpoint calls immediately.** Do not retry — a rejected key won't be accepted on a second try; every subsequent call will return 401 too.
2. **Report to the user**:
   - The `APICLAW_API_KEY` in use was rejected (likely invalid, revoked, or expired)
   - If any partial findings were collected before the failure, show them and mark as partial
   - Fix at https://apiclaw.io/en/api-keys (verify the key, regenerate if needed)
3. **Do not fabricate or guess** the data the failed calls would have returned.

## On 402 Credit Exhausted

When `apiclaw.py` returns `{"code": 402, "message": "API quota exhausted or subscription expired"}`:

1. **STOP further endpoint calls immediately.** Do not retry. Do not switch endpoints as a workaround — 402 is account-level (key/subscription), not endpoint-level.
2. **Report to the user** with all four of:
   - Which step in the workflow was reached (e.g. "Completed step 3/5: brand analysis")
   - Partial findings already collected (show the actual data, not just a list of completed steps)
   - Rough credits needed to resume (sum remaining-step costs from this skill's API Budget table)
   - Top-up link: https://apiclaw.io/en/pricing
3. **Do not fabricate or guess** the missing data to "complete" the report. Mark partial findings explicitly as partial.

## 12 Endpoints

| # | Endpoint | Purpose | Key Output |
|---|----------|---------|------------|
| 1 | `categories` | Browse/search category tree | categoryPath, productCount |
| 2 | `markets/search` | Market-level metrics | sampleAvgMonthlySales, sampleAvgPrice, topSalesRate, sampleNewSkuRate |
| 3 | `products/search` | Product search (14 modes) | asin, price, monthlySalesFloor, rating, ratingCount, fbaFee |
| 4 | `products/competitors` | Competitor discovery | same fields as products/search |
| 5 | `realtime/product` | Live ASIN detail | rating, features, bestsellersRank[], buyboxWinner.price, variants |
| 6 | `reviews/analysis` | AI review insights (11 dims) | sentimentDistribution, consumerInsights, topKeywords |
| 7 | `realtime/reviews` | Live raw review text (cursor paginated, max 100) | reviews[], nextCursor — feeds Local Review Toolkit |
| 8 | `products/price-band-overview` | Price band summary | hottestBand, bestOpportunityBand, sampleOpportunityIndex |
| 9 | `products/price-band-detail` | Full 5-band distribution | priceBands[] with sales, brands, ratings per band |
| 10 | `products/brand-overview` | Brand concentration | sampleTop10BrandSalesRate (CR10), sampleBrandCount |
| 11 | `products/brand-detail` | Per-brand breakdown | brands[] with sales, revenue, sampleProducts |
| 12 | `products/history` | Time series (single ASIN per call) | timestamps[], price[], bsr[], monthlySalesFloor[], rating[], ratingCount[], sellerCount[], title/imageUrl/bestSeller/newRelease/aPlus/inventoryStatus changelogs |

## Known Quirks
- `topN`, `listingAge`, `newProductPeriod` are **strings** (`"10"` not `10`)
- Response `.data` is always an **array** — use `.data[0]`
- `ratingCount` not `reviewCount` everywhere
- `bsr` (int) in products vs `bestsellersRank` (array) in realtime
- `buyboxWinner.price` — NOT top-level `price` in realtime
- `realtime/product` does NOT return: monthlySalesFloor, fbaFee, sellerCount
- `reviewCountMin/Max` filters currently broken (API-56)
- `reviews/analysis` may 500 for certain ASINs (API-58) — retry different ASIN
- Rate limit: 100 req/min, 10 req/sec burst
- `categories` uses `categoryKeyword` (not `keyword`) and `parentCategoryPath` (not `parentCategoryName`)
- `reviews/analysis`: `mode` required ("asin"/"category"), use `asins` (plural array) not `asin`
- `realtime/reviews`: returns 10 reviews/page fixed (no `pageSize` param); 1 credit/page; cursor-paginated; hard cap = 100 reviews (10 pages); supports `marketplace` US/UK only

## Local Review Toolkit

When `/reviews/analysis` lacks aggregation (ASIN has <50 reviews or no daily snapshot),
fall back to live raw reviews + your own LLM. The toolkit does NOT call any external
LLM — you (the calling skill's LLM) perform the Map/Reduce steps.

**Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Fetch raw reviews (up to 100, cursor-paginated, ~60s, 10 credits at full)
apiclaw.py reviews-raw --asin B0XXXXXXXX [--marketplace US] [--max-pages 10]

# 2. For EACH review, render the per-review Map prompt
apiclaw.py review-tag-prompt --review '<single review JSON>' \
    [--product-title "..."] [--product-category "..."]
# → Your LLM produces a JSON object with sentiment + 11 dimension arrays
#   (mentioned_scenarios, mentioned_issues, mentioned_positives, mentioned_improvements,
#    mentioned_buying_factors, mentioned_pain_points, user_profiles, mentioned_usage_times,
#    mentioned_usage_locations, mentioned_behaviors, keywords)
# Suggested map parallelism: ~20 concurrent if your LLM supports it

# 3. Collect candidate phrases per dimension. For EACH dimension render the Reduce prompt
apiclaw.py review-reduce-prompt --label-type positives \
    --candidates '["comfortable","comfy","very comfortable",...]'
# → Your LLM produces {clusters: [{canonical, members}, ...]}
# Suggested chunk size for `keywords` dim when >150 candidates: 150 per call

# 4. Aggregate into reviews/analysis-compatible consumerInsights
apiclaw.py review-aggregate --reviews raw.json --tagged tags.json --clusters clusters.json
# → Output shape matches /reviews/analysis: reviewCount, avgRating,
#   sentimentDistribution, consumerInsights[], topKeywords[]
```

**When to use the toolkit instead of `reviews/analysis`:**
- ASIN has fewer than 50 reviews
- `reviews/analysis` returns sparse `consumerInsights` (missing dimensions)
- Need the freshest possible data (Spider scrape vs. T+1 BigQuery snapshot)
- Need to analyze a brand-new product that has no daily snapshot yet

## Field Differences Across Endpoints

| Data | markets | products/competitors | realtime/product | reviews/analysis | realtime/reviews | price-band | brand | history |
|------|---------|---------------------|----------|---------|---------|------------|-------|---------|

| BSR | sampleAvgBsr | bsr (int) | bestsellersRank[] | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | bsr[] |
| Rating | sampleAvgRating | rating | rating | avgRating | rating (per review) | sampleAvgRating | sampleAvgRating | rating[] |
| Reviews | sampleAvgReviewCount | ratingCount | ratingCount | reviewCount | reviews[] (raw text, max 100) | ❌ | sampleAvgRatingCount | ratingCount[] |
| Insights | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ consumerInsights | ❌ (raw only — feeds Local Review Toolkit) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Concentration | topSalesRate | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | sampleTop3BrandSalesRate | CR10 | ❌ |
| Opportunity | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | sampleOpportunityIndex | ❌ | ❌ |

## Confidence Labels (all skills)
- 📊 **Data-backed** — direct API data
- 🔍 **Inferred** — logical reasoning from data
- 💡 **Directional** — suggestions, predictions

Strategy recommendations and subjective conclusions are NEVER 📊. Extreme growth (>200%) = 💡 only.

## Data Notes
- Sales (`monthlySalesFloor`) = lower-bound estimate
- Realtime = live; products/competitors = ~T+1 delay
- Amazon US only (amazon.com) — more marketplaces planned
- Each call consumes credits; check `meta.creditsConsumed`
