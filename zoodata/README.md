Keyword endpoint note: ZooData keyword data is estimated search, exposure, visibility, rank, placement, and impression evidence; it is not seller ABA-SQP or Amazon Ads performance. Analysis-stage routing, seller-artifact acquisition, and output policy are owned by [`amazon-keyword-traffic-analysis`](../amazon-keyword-traffic-analysis/).

Keyword date rule: keyword workflows are keyword-query lookups. When a keyword endpoint requires `date` or `dateTo`, prefer T-1 or earlier and avoid current-date lookup unless the user explicitly asks for today's data.

## Credit Cost

Varies per endpoint. Each call consumes credits — check `meta.creditsConsumed` in response. 1,000 free credits on signup.
